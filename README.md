Overview
The Automated News Categorization project is a machine learning-based system designed to classify news articles into predefined categories. The model processes textual news data and assigns relevant categories based on the article content. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate classification.

 Features
 Automated Classification: Categorizes news articles into specific topics using ML models.
 NLP-Powered: Implements text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.
 Data Processing: Handles large datasets with text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
 Machine Learning Models: Uses algorithms like NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Transformer-based models for classification.
 Performance Evaluation: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
